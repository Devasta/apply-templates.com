        <xh:p>Merry Christmas all, I hope that Santa got you everything you asked for.</xh:p>
        <xh:p>This post is just an excuse for me to mess around with <xh:a href="https://github.com/AlainCouthures/xsltforms">XSLTForms</xh:a>, Alain Couthures fantastic implementation of the XForms spec. I've used it to implement a basic calculator to determine the environmental impact of Bitcoin based on its current price.</xh:p>
        <xh:iframe style="width:100%; height:400px; border:none;" scrolling="no" src="calculator.xml"/>
        <xh:p>Xforms is more proof, as if it were needed, that abandoning XML was and continues to be the webs biggest mistake.</xh:p>
